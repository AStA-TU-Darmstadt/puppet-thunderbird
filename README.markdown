# Thunderbird #

This module installs Thunderbird and creates a thunderbird.cfg for autoconfiguration based on the current user name.

It is shipped with a default template with Kerberos authentification for IMAP, SMTP and LDAP, 
with most settings (server name, organisation, ..) configurable via class parameters.

You can use your own template if you need a different setup.
